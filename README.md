# Web-Autimation-using-selenium
If you want to open any website, but first you have to enter all your credentials ( isn't this irritating?). So what if your python code will do this for you...interesting;-)!!

Web automation is the magic by which you can do the following:-

1) automate your Facebook Sign-In
2) automate message sending on whatsapp
3) automate google search and take note
4) you can also check your attendance from your university website just by one click.

There are a lot of packages you can use but i have use selenium for web automation.
